Agglomerative/Hierarchical Clustering using average linkage was found to be a better fit for the data, as it achieved the highest silhouette score of all the methods. 
Under this method the most apt cluster number was 2, hence the customers can be divided into:

0 -> Infrequent/Inactive Flyers: Make up majority of the data but contribute the least in terms of miles covered. Their transaction volume is high but volume per transaction is very low. 

1-> Frequent/Active Flyers: Make up a small part but contribute the highest in terms of miles covered. Though they have a lower transaction volume the miles earned per transaction are much higher. 
They also have a higher mean balance. The individual in this cluster might be high spenders.

KMeans was also a close second in terms of performance with a high 0.36 silhouette score at clusters=2, whereas DBScan was the worst performing with a silhouette score of 0.1 at 19 cluster value.
